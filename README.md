# Background
In this case study, I have investigated customer behavior on the EzBuy Malaysia e-commerce platform using a comprehensive two dataset of customer demographic and customer purchase history. This dataset includes detailed customer attributes and purchase history over the past year, offering insights into consumer trends. This analysis employs three tools which are Talend Data Integration for merging customer demographic data and purchase history data, Talend Data Preparation for data cleaning and standardization, and SAS Enterprise Miner for behavioral modeling. These tools enable us to understand customer preferences and patterns, aiding in improving user experience and driving business growth on the EzBuy Malaysia platform.

# Objective
To evaluate the application of decision tree and ensemble methods to real-world e-commerce data, aiming to extract actionable insights into customer behavior on the EzBuy Malaysia platform.

# Tools
The choice of tools for this data analysis workflow was driven by the specific challenges and requirements of the data integration, preparation, and modelling processes. Talend Data Integration was chosen to handle complex schema mismatches and data transformations, while Talend Data Preparation was selected to address data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. SAS Enterprise Miner was chosen for its ability to handle ensemble methods, allowing for a more comprehensive and robust approach to model selection and evaluation. The Model Comparison component in SAS Enterprise Miner enables the systematic assessment of evaluation metrics to determine the best-performing model for predicting the target variable.
